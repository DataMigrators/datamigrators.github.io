## Overview

Remote access to our corporate network is essential to maintain our
Team's productivity, but in many cases this remote access originates
from networks that may already be compromised or are at a significantly
lower security posture than our corporate network. While these remote
networks are beyond the control of Hypergolic Reactions, LLC policy, we
must mitigate these external risks the best of our ability.

## Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to define rules and requirements for
connecting to Data Migrators\'s network from any host. These rules and
requirements are designed to minimize the potential exposure to
Data Migrators from damages which may result from unauthorized use of
Data Migrators resources. Damages include the loss of sensitive or
company confidential data, intellectual property, damage to public
image, damage to critical Data Migrators internal systems, and fines
or other financial liabilities incurred as a result of those losses.

## Scope

This policy applies to all Data Migrators employees, contractors,
vendors and agents with a Data Migrators-owned or personally-owned
computer or workstation used to connect to the Data Migrators network.
This policy applies to remote access connections used to do work on
behalf of Data Migrators, including reading or sending email and
viewing intranet web resources. This policy covers any and all technical
implementations of remote access used to connect to Data Migrators
networks.

## Policy

It is the responsibility of Data Migrators employees, contractors,
vendors and agents with remote access privileges to Data Migrators\'s
corporate network to ensure that their remote access connection is given
the same consideration as the user\'s on-site connection to Data Migrators.

General access to the Internet for recreational use through the
Data Migrators network is strictly limited to Data Migrators
employees, contractors, vendors and agents (hereafter referred to as
"Authorized Users"). When accessing the Data Migrators network from a
personal computer, Authorized Users are responsible for preventing
access to any Data Migrators computer resources or data by
non-Authorized Users. Performance of illegal activities through the
Data Migrators network by any user (Authorized or otherwise) is
prohibited. The Authorized User bears responsibility for and
consequences of misuse of the Authorized User's access. For further
information and definitions, see the *Acceptable Use Policy*.

Authorized Users will not use Data Migrators networks to access the
Internet for outside business interests.

For additional information regarding Data Migrators\'s remote access
connection options, including how to obtain a remote access login, free
anti-virus software, troubleshooting, etc., go to the Remote Access
Services website (company url).

### Requirements

1.  Secure remote access must be strictly controlled with encryption
    (i.e., Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)) and strong pass-phrases.
    For further information see the *Acceptable Encryption Policy*
    and the *Password Policy*.

2.  Authorized Users shall protect their login and password, even
    from family members.

3.  While using a Data Migrators-owned computer to remotely
    connect to Data Migrators\'s corporate network, Authorized
    Users shall ensure the remote host is not connected to any other
    network at the same time, with the exception of personal
    networks that are under their complete control or under the
    complete control of an Authorized User or Third Party.

4.  Use of external resources to conduct Data Migrators business
    must be approved in advance by InfoSec and the appropriate
    business unit manager.

5.  All hosts that are connected to Data Migrators internal
    networks via remote access technologies must use the most
    up-to-date anti-virus software (place url to corporate software
    site here), this includes personal computers. Third party
    connections must comply with requirements as stated in the
    *Third Party Agreement*.

6.  Personal equipment used to connect to Data Migrators'
    networks must meet the requirements of Data Migrators-owned
    equipment for remote access as stated in the Hardware and
    Software Configuration Standards for Remote Access to Data Migrators Networks.
