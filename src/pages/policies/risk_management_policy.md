## Overview

See Purpose.

## Purpose

To clarify Data Migrators' policy on Risk Management, and the processes that support
that policy.


## Scope

This Policy applies to all Company officers, employees, partners, and
contractors to facilities and systems controlled by the Company. The
policy extends to all current and future activities, and new opportunities.

Where necessary, more detailed risk management policies and procedures will
be developed to cover specific areas of the Company's operations, such as 
financial management and business management.


## Policy

### Recognition of the need for risk management ###

Data Migrators recognises the need for risk management to feature as a
consideration in strategic and operational planning, day-to-day management 
and decision making at all levels in the organisation.

### A commitment to implement risk management effectively ###

Data Migrators is committed to managing and minimising risk by identifying, 
analysing, evaluating and treating exposures that may impact on the Company
achieving its objectives and/or the continued efficiency and effectiveness of
its operations. Data Migrators will incorporate risk management into its 
organisational planning and decision-making processes. Risk management must 
also be included as a consideration in sectional and operational planning as 
a delegated line management responsibility. Data Migrators staff must implement 
risk management according to relevant legislative requirements and appropriate 
risk management standards.

### A commitment to training and knowledge development in the area of risk management ###

Data Migrators is committed to ensuring that all staff, particularly those with 
management, advisory, and decision making responsibilities, obtain a sound understanding 
of the principles of risk management and the requisite skills to implement risk 
management effectively.

### A commitment to monitor performance and review progress in risk management ###

Data Migrators will regularly monitor and review the progress being made in 
developing an appropriate culture of risk management and the effective 
implementation of risk management strategies throughout the organisation as 
a basis for continuous improvement.


## Principles ##

### Responsibility for Risk Management ###

Risk must first and foremost be managed at the corporate level as part of the Company's 
good governance and corporate management processes. Risk management is considered an 
integral part of all management and decision-making functions within Data Migrators. 
The responsibility for the identification of risk and the implementation of control 
strategies and follow up remains a delegated line management responsibility. All 
stakeholders have a significant role in the management of risk. This role may range 
from initially identifying and reporting risks associated with their own jobs to 
participation in the risk management process. Data Migrators Directors will facilitate 
the introduction and monitoring of risk management into key areas of Data Migrators' 
activities

### Objectives of and Rationale for Risk Management ###

1. Data Migrators, in its need for risk management, aims to:
    * facilitate and review risk management activities across the institution through Data Migrators Directors;
    * integrate risk management into the management culture of the Company; and
    * foster an environment where staff assume responsibility for managing risks.
2. To secure its commitment to implement risk management effectively, Data Migrators aims to:
    * implement risk management across all aspects of the Company in accordance with best practice guidelines.
3. To secure its commitment to training and knowledge development in the area of risk management, Data Migrators aims to:
    ensure that performance in risk management is a consideration in the Company's performance management systems; and
    ensure that staff and other stakeholders have access to appropriate information, training and other development opportunities in the area of risk management.
4. To secure its commitment to monitoring performance and reviewing progress, Data Migrators aims to:
    * ensure that appropriate monitoring, review and reporting processes are in place in the area of risk management.
5. The objectives of risk management are to:
    * provide a structured basis for strategic, tactical and operational planning across Data Migrators;
    * enhance Data Migrators' governance and corporate management processes;
    * enable Data Migrators to effectively discharge its statutory and legislative financial management responsibilities;
    * provide a practical framework for managers to assess risks inherent in the decisions they take;
    * assist and motivate decision makers, at all levels, to make good and proactive management decisions that do not expose Data Migrators to unacceptable levels of risk of unfavourable events occurring which adversely impact on the attainment of organisational goals; encourage and commit decision makers to identify sound business opportunities that will benefit Data Migrators without exposing the Company to unacceptable levels of risk;
    * minimise the risks of not identifying sound business opportunities;
    * protect Data Migrators from unacceptable costs or losses associated with its operations;
    * safeguarding of Data Migrators' resources - its people, finance, property and reputation;
    * assist Data Migrators in achieving its strategic objectives; and
    * create an environment where all staff assume responsibility for risk management


## Procedures ##

### Whole of Company Risk Management Process ###

Risk must first and foremost be managed at the corporate level as part of Data Migrators' 
good governance and corporate management processes. This process, coordinated and 
facilitated by Data Migrators Directors, will involve the following key steps:

1. an annual risk identification exercise undertaken by Data Migrators Directors, 
which involves assessment of the consequence and likelihood of risk, the development 
and/or review of individual risk management plans for the risks identified which 
exceed the Organisation's defined acceptable risks;
2. wherever practicable the inclusion of a Risk Management Assessment for all 
business activities;
3. the incorporation of risk management into Company strategic planning, and 
operational and resource management planning processes;
4. annual review of the risk management activities by Data Migrators Directors;
5. at least annual assessment by Data Migrators Directors of action taken in 
respect of risk management;
6. ensure risk management processes are incorporated into the quality assurance 
and improvement systems of the Company;
7. clearly define and document escalation procedures for risk management;
8. ensure a consistency in approach of responses to the same risk by different 
sections of the Company;
9. document all risks with a potentially high impact, as assessed on the basis 
of their likely occurrence or impact; and
10. test documented risk management procedures at appropriate intervals.

#### Risk Management as a Delegated Line Management Responsibility ####

Risk management is a delegated line management responsibility. It is the 
responsibility of all line managers to continually monitor their areas of 
responsibility to ensure that risks are identified and managed. Line managers
should ensure that a contribution is made to the whole-of-Company risk 
management process, on behalf of their areas of responsibility, that identifies 
risks at all levels.

The sharing of documented responses to risks and knowledge of risk management 
principles and procedures will be fostered between line managers to ensure 
consistency across the Company.

On an annual basis, line managers should review all activities to ensure that 
any unacceptable risk exposures are identified and managed at an appropriate 
level. All operational sections will be required to report on risk management 
as part of the institution's annual operational and resource management process.

#### Individual ####

Each employee or other stakeholder throughout the Company has a role in the 
risk management process and is responsible for actively participating in the 
risk management process as appropriate to their position within the Company.

#### Management of Risks Associated with New Opportunities ####

In addition to the risks that already exist, the Company is continually 
exposed to new risks particularly from the introduction of new activities. The 
new risks should be incorporated into the initial planning and assessment 
processes conducted prior to undertaking the activity and, subsequently, into the 
annual risk management assessment at the appropriate level(s) of activity and 
management.

### Principles to be Applied ###

The principles of risk management shall be applied to all areas of risk exposure, 
insurable and non-insurable, and shall include, but not be limited to the following 
areas:

| * Fire prevention measures and security precautions                  | * Crisis contingency planning and disaster recovery
| * Property loss and damage                                           | * Accounting controls that are not cost effective
| * Computer security                                                  | * Loss of key staff and intellectual property
| * Vehicle fleet management                                           | * The impact of globalisation on risk exposures
| * Professional negligence                                            | * Management system inadequacies and poor work quality
| * Other liability exposures                                          | * Failure or disruption of a major income source or investment

### Review ###

Data Migrators Directors will regularly monitor and review the  progress being 
made in developing an appropriate culture of risk management and the effective 
implementation of risk management strategies throughout the organisation.

### Guidance on Acceptable Risk ###

Through its monitoring, review and reporting functions, Data Migrators' Directors
will ensure that the Company maintains a consistent approach to its assessment
of acceptable risk.

### Documentation

Each stage of the risk management process shall be appropriately documented. The 
extent of documentation required is dependent on the nature of the risk. 
Documentation will be controlled so as to inform part of an auditable quality 
management process.

### Compliance ###

A representation and compliance statement should be provided by each project manager
as formal acknowledgement of their responsibility to comply with risk management 
policies and procedures. Each employee should have included in their Position 
Description a responsibility for risk management, and Annual Performance Appraisals 
should include an appropriate assessment thereof.

### Staff Development ###

Management shall ensure that staff have available to them appropriate information and 
training opportunities in risk management as appropriate to their position and role 
within Data Migrators.
