## Overview

See Purpose.

## Purpose

To empower Infosec to perform periodic information security risk
assessments (RAs) for the purpose of determining areas of vulnerability,
and to initiate appropriate remediation.

## Scope

Risk assessments can be conducted on any entity within Data Migrators
or any outside entity that has signed a *Third Party Agreement* with
Data Migrators. RAs can be conducted on any information system, to
include applications, servers, and networks, and any process or
procedure by which these systems are administered and/or maintained.

## Policy

The execution, development and implementation of remediation programs is
the joint responsibility of Infosec and the department responsible for
the system area being assessed. Employees are expected to cooperate
fully with any RA being conducted on systems for which they are held
accountable. Employees are further expected to work with the Infosec
Risk Assessment Team in the development of a remediation plan.

For additional information, go to the *Risk Assessment Process*.
