## Overview

Data Migrators is committed to managing Information as an organisational asset that is created, used and shared effectively while meeting legislative requirements.

Information governance provides the framework, strategic objectives, policies and standards to manage Information as an asset. This policy, supporting procedures and associated resources support effective Information governance to optimise the integrity, security, availability and quality of DM Information.

## Purpose

This policy establishes the framework and principles for effective data and information (Information) governance which supports the functions and activities of DM.


## Scope

This policy applies to all individuals who manage, handle or process DM Information, including DM staff, contractors, visitors and partners. This also includes third parties (suppliers) and agents of the organisation who are bound to DM policy where their contract of engagement with the organisation specifically provides for this.

This policy applies to the creation, storage, management, control, access, transfer and destruction of Information throughout its lifecycle in all its forms: both in digital and non-electronic formats.

## Policy

### Principles

Data Quality from creation - DM implements procedures and practices to ensure that Information is captured accurately and completely, and that the quality of Information is monitored, managed and continuously improved throughout its lifecycle.

**Information is discoverable** - DM Information classification is applied to enable appropriate management of Information, to ensure Information is easy to find and to promote its re-use. 

**DM supports openness and collaboration** - DM Information is accessible and transparent. Access to Information should only be restricted when required by legislation, policy or contract. 

**Information is protected from unauthorised access, use and disclosure** - DM Information is managed in accordance with procedures and resources established by this policy, the Privacy Policy, and the Information Technology and Security Policy.

**Information is retained, managed and disposed of lawfully and ethically** – DM Information collection, creation, use, re-use and exchange is performed according to ethical practices, applicable laws and with due consideration for individual privacy. 

**DM is a digital organisation** - Information is created and retained in a digital format unless otherwise required by legislation.

**A data-literate workforce** - DM is committed to ensuring that staff have the knowledge, competencies and ability to interact with Information in their roles.

### Information Governance Framework

The Information Governance Board provides advice and recommendations for strategy, policy and risk-related matters impacting DM's Information.

Information Governance priorities are guided by the value of Information to DM, government and the community over time, considering the risks of improper management of Information.

DM is the custodian of all Information managed by DM. No individual function or group own any part of Information.

An individual assumes the role of Information Custodian when DM Information is in their possession.

Information Governance controls are defined in consultation with Information Stewards. The Information Stewards Group is established to provide operational support and recommendations to the Information Governance Board.
