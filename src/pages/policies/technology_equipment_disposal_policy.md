## Overview

Technology equipment often contains parts which cannot simply be thrown
away. Proper disposal of equipment is both environmentally responsible
and often required by law. In addition, hard drives, USB drives, CD-ROMs
and other storage media contain various kinds of Data Migrators data,
some of which is considered sensitive. In order to protect our
constituent's data, all storage mediums must be properly erased before
being disposed of. However, simply deleting or even formatting data is
not considered sufficient. When deleting files or formatting a device,
data is marked for deletion, but is still accessible until being
overwritten by a new file. Therefore, special tools must be used to
securely erase data prior to equipment disposal.

## Purpose

The purpose of this policy it to define the guidelines for the disposal
of technology equipment and components owned by Data Migrators.

## Scope

This policy applies to any computer/technology equipment or peripheral
devices that are no longer needed within Data Migrators including, but
not limited to the following:Â  personal computers, servers, hard drives,
laptops, mainframes, smart phones, or handheld computers ( i.e., Windows
Mobile, iOS or Android-based devices), peripherals (i.e., keyboards,
mice, speakers), printers, scanners, typewriters, compact and floppy
discs, portable storage devices (i.e., USB drives), backup tapes,
printed materials.

All Data Migrators employees and affiliates must comply with this
policy.

## Policy

### Technology Equipment Disposal

1.  When Technology assets have reached the end of their useful
    life they should be sent to the Equipment Disposal Team
    office for proper disposal.

2.  The Equipment Disposal Team will securely erase all
    storage mediums in accordance with current industry best
    practices.

3.  All data including, all files and licensed software shall be
    removed from equipment using disk sanitizing software that
    cleans the media overwriting each and every disk sector of
    the machine with zero-filled blocks, meeting Department of
    Defense standards.

4.  No computer or technology equipment may be sold to any
    individual other than through the processes identified in
    this policy (Section 4.2 below).

5.  No computer equipment should be disposed of via skips,
    dumps, landfill etc. Electronic recycling bins may be
    periodically placed in locations around Data Migrators.
    These can be used to dispose of equipment. The Equipment
    Disposal Team will properly remove all data prior to final
    disposal.

6.  All electronic drives must be degaussed or overwritten with
    a commercially available disk cleaning program. Hard drives
    may also be removed and rendered unreadable (drilling,
    crushing or other demolition methods).

7.  Computer Equipment refers to desktop, laptop, tablet or
    netbook computers, printers, copiers, monitors, servers,
    handheld devices, telephones, cell phones, disc drives or
    any storage device, network switches, routers, wireless
    access points, batteries, backup tapes, etc.

8.  The Equipment Disposal Team will place a sticker on the
    equipment case indicating the disk wipe has been performed.
    The sticker will include the date and the initials of the
    technician who performed the disk wipe.

9.  Technology equipment with non-functioning memory or storage
    technology will have the memory or storage device removed
    and it will be physically destroyed.

### Employee Purchase of Disposed Equipment

1.  Equipment which is working, but reached the end of its
    useful life to Data Migrators, will be made available for
    purchase by employees.

2.  A lottery system will be used to determine who has the
    opportunity to purchase available equipment.

3.  All equipment purchases must go through the lottery process.
    Employees cannot purchase their office computer directly or
    "reserve" a system. This ensures that all employees have an
    equal chance of obtaining equipment.

4.  Finance and Information Technology will determine an
    appropriate cost for each item.

5.  All purchases are final. No warranty or support will be
    provided with any equipment sold.

6.  Any equipment not in working order or remaining from the
    lottery process will be donated or disposed of according to
    current environmental guidelines. Information

7.  Technology has contracted with several organizations to
    donate or properly dispose of outdated technology assets.

8.  Prior to leaving Data Migrators premises, all equipment
    must be removed from the Information Technology inventory
    system.
