## Overview

With advances in computer technology, mobile computing and storage
devices have become useful tools to meet the business needs at the
Data Migrators. These devices are especially susceptible to loss,
theft, hacking, and the distribution of malicious software because they
are easily portable and can be used anywhere. As mobile computing
becomes more widely used, it is necessary to address security to protect
information resources at the Data Migrators.

## Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to establish an authorized method for
controlling mobile computing and storage devices that contain or access
information resources at the Data Migrators.

## Scope

Data Migrators employees, consultants, vendors, contractors, and others
who use mobile computing and storage devices on the network
at the Data Migrators.

## Policy

### General Policy

It is the policy of the Data Migrators that mobile computing and
storage devices containing or accessing the information resources at the
Data Migrators must be approved prior to connecting to the information
systems at the Data Migrators. This pertains to all devices connecting
to the network at the Data Migrators, regardless of ownership.

Mobile computing and storage devices include, but are not limited to:
laptop computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), plug-ins,
Universal Serial Bus (USB) port devices, Compact Discs (CDs), Digital
Versatile Discs (DVDs), flash drives, modems, handheld wireless devices,
wireless networking cards, and any other existing or future mobile
computing or storage device, either personally owned or Data Migrators
owned, that may connect to or access the information systems at
the Data Migrators. A risk analysis for each new media type shall be
conducted and documented prior to its use or connection to the network
at the Data Migrators unless the media type has already been approved
by the Desktop Standards Committee. The Desktop Standards Committee will
maintain a list of approved mobile computing and storage devices.

Mobile computing and storage devices are easily lost or stolen,
presenting a high risk for unauthorized access and introduction of
malicious software to the network at the Data Migrators. These risks
must be mitigated to acceptable levels.

Portable computing devices and portable electronic storage media that
contain confidential, personal, or sensitive Data Migrators
information must use encryption or equally strong measures to protect
the data while it is being stored.

Unless written approval has been obtained from the Data Resource Manager
and Chief Information Security Officer, databases or portions thereof,
which reside on the network at the Data Migrators, shall not be
downloaded to mobile computing or storage devices.

### Procedures

To report lost or stolen mobile computing and storage devices, call the
Enterprise Help Desk. For further procedures on lost or stolen handheld
wireless devices, please see the Procedures section.

The Data Migrators Desktop Standards Committee shall approve all new
mobile computing and storage devices that may connect to information
systems at the Data Migrators.

Any non-departmental owned device that may connect to the Data Migrators
network must first be approved by technical personnel such as
those from the Data Migrators Desktop Support. Refer to the Mobile
Media Standards for detailed information.

### Roles & Responsibilities

Users of mobile computing and storage devices must diligently protect
such devices from loss of equipment and disclosure of private
information belonging to or maintained by the Data Migrators. Before
connecting a mobile computing or storage device to the network at
Data Migrators, users must ensure it is on the list of approved
devices issued by the ISD.

The Enterprise Help Desk must be notified immediately upon detection of
a security incident, especially when a mobile device may have been lost
or stolen.

The Infosec Team is responsible for the mobile device policy at the
Data Migrators and shall conduct a risk analysis to document
safeguards for each media type to be used on the network or on equipment
owned by the Data Migrators.

The Information Systems Division (ISD) is responsible for developing
procedures for implementing this policy. The Desktop Standards Committee
will maintain a list of approved mobile computing and storage devices
and will make the list available on the intranet.

## Policy Compliance

### Compliance Measurement

The Infosec team will verify compliance to this policy through various
methods, including but not limited to, periodic walk-thrus, video
monitoring, business tool reports, internal and external audits, and
feedback to the policy owner.

## Exceptions

Any exception to the policy must be approved by the Infosec team in
advance.

## Non-Compliance

An employee found to have violated this policy may be subject to
disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

## Related Standards, Policies and Processes
