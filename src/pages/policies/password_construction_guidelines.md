## Overview

Passwords are a critical component of information security. Passwords
serve to protect user accounts; however, a poorly constructed password
may result in the compromise of individual systems, data, or network.
This guideline provides best practices for creating secure passwords.

## Purpose

The purpose of this guidelines is to provide best practices for the
created of strong passwords.

## Scope

This guideline applies to employees, contractors, consultants, temporary
and other workers, including all personnel affiliated with third
parties. This guideline applies to all passwords including but not
limited to user-level accounts, system-level accounts, web accounts,
e-mail accounts, screen saver protection, voicemail, and local router
logins.

## Statement of Guidelines

Strong passwords are long, the more characters you have the stronger the
password. We recommend a minimum of 14 characters in your password. In
addition, we highly encourage the use of passphrases, passwords made up
of multiple words. Examples include "*It's time for vacation*" or
"*block-curious-sunny-leaves*". Passphrases are both easy to remember
and type, yet meet the strength requirements. Poor, or weak, passwords
have the following characteristics:

-   Contain eight characters or less.
-   Contain personal information such as birthdates, addresses, phone
    numbers, or names of family members, pets, friends, and fantasy
    characters.
-   Contain number patterns such as `aaabbb`, `qwerty`, `zyxwvuts`, or `123321`.
-   Are some version of `"Welcome123"` `"Password123"` `"Changeme123"`

In addition, every work account should have a different, unique
password. To enable users to maintain multiple passwords, we highly
encourage the use of 'password manager' software that is authorized and
provided by the organization. Whenever possible, also enable the use of
multi-factor authentication.
