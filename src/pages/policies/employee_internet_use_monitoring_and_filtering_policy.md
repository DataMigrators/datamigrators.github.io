## Overview

See Purpose.

## Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to define standards for systems that
monitor and limit web use from any host within Data Migrators'
network. These standards are designed to ensure employees use the
Internet in a safe and responsible manner, and ensure that employee web
use can be monitored or researched during an incident.

## Scope

This policy applies to all Data Migrators employees, contractors,
vendors and agents with a Data Migrators-owned or personally-owned
computer or workstation connected to the Data Migrators network.

This policy applies to all end user initiated communications between
Data Migrators' network and the Internet, including web browsing,
instant messaging, file transfer, file sharing, and other standard and
proprietary protocols. Server to Server communications, such as SMTP
traffic, backups, automated data transfers or database communications
are excluded from this policy.

## Policy

### Web Site Monitoring

The Information Technology Department shall monitor Internet use from
all computers and devices connected to the corporate network. For all
traffic the monitoring system must record the source IP Address, the
date, the time, the protocol, and the destination site or server. Where
possible, the system should record the User ID of the person or account
initiating the traffic. Internet Use records must be preserved for 180
days.

### Access to Web Site Monitoring Reports

General trending and activity reports will be made available to any
employee as needed upon request to the Information Technology
Department. Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) members may
access all reports and data if necessary to respond to a security
incident. Internet Use reports that identify specific users, sites,
teams, or devices will only be made available to associates outside the
CSIRT upon written or email request to Information Systems from a Human
Resources Representative.

### Internet Use Filtering System

The Information Technology Department shall block access to Internet
websites and protocols that are deemed inappropriate for Data Migrators's corporate environment. The following protocols and categories
of websites should be blocked:

-   Adult/Sexually Explicit Material

-   Advertisements & Pop-Ups

-   Chat and Instant Messaging

-   Gambling

-   Hacking

-   Illegal Drugs

-   Intimate Apparel and Swimwear

-   Peer to Peer File Sharing

-   Personals and Dating

-   Social Network Services

-   SPAM, Phishing and Fraud

-   Spyware

-   Tasteless and Offensive Content

-   Violence, Intolerance and Hate

-   Web Based Email

### Internet Use Filtering Rule Changes

The Information Technology Department shall periodically review and
recommend changes to web and protocol filtering rules. Human Resources
shall review these recommendations and decide if any changes are to be
made. Changes to web and protocol filtering rules will be recorded in
the Internet Use Monitoring and Filtering Policy.

### Internet Use Filtering Exceptions

If a site is mis-categorized, employees may request the site be
un-blocked by submitting a ticket to the Information Technology help
desk. An IT employee will review the request and un-block the site if it
is mis-categorized.

Employees may access blocked sites with permission if appropriate and
necessary for business purposes. If an employee needs access to a site
that is blocked and appropriately categorized, they must submit a
request to their Human Resources representative. HR will present all
approved exception requests to Information Technology in writing or by
email. Information Technology will unblock that site or category for
that associate only. Information Technology will track approved
exceptions and report on them upon request.

## Policy Compliance

### Compliance Measurement

The Infosec team will verify compliance to this policy through various
methods, including but not limited to, periodic walk-thrus, video
monitoring, business tool reports, internal and external audits, and
feedback to the policy owner.

## Exceptions

Any exception to the policy must be approved by the Infosec team in
advance.

## Non-Compliance

An employee found to have violated this policy may be subject to
disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
