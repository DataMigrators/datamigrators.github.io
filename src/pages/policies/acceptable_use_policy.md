## Overview

Infosec's intentions for publishing an Acceptable Use Policy are not to
impose restrictions that are contrary to Data Migrators' established
culture of openness, trust and integrity. Infosec is committed to
protecting Data Migrators' employees, partners and the company from
illegal or damaging actions by individuals, either knowingly or
unknowingly.

Internet/Intranet/Extranet-related systems, including but not limited to
computer equipment, software, operating systems, storage media, network
accounts providing electronic mail, WWW browsing, and FTP, are the
property of Data Migrators. These systems are to be used for business
purposes in serving the interests of the company, and of our clients and
customers in the course of normal operations. Please review Human
Resources policies for further details.

Effective security is a team effort involving the participation and
support of every Data Migrators employee and affiliate who deals with
information and/or information systems. It is the responsibility of
every computer user to know these guidelines, and to conduct their
activities accordingly.

## Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to outline the acceptable use of computer
equipment at Data Migrators. These rules are in place to protect the
employee and Data Migrators. Inappropriate use exposes Data Migrators 
to risks including virus attacks, compromise of network systems
and services, and legal issues.

## Scope

This policy applies to the use of information, electronic and computing
devices, and network resources to conduct Data Migrators business or
interact with internal networks and business systems, whether owned or
leased by Data Migrators, the employee, or a third party. All
employees, contractors, consultants, temporary, and other workers at
Data Migrators and its subsidiaries are responsible for exercising
good judgment regarding appropriate use of information, electronic
devices, and network resources in accordance with Data Migrators
policies and standards, and local laws and regulation. Exceptions to
this policy are documented in section 5.2

This policy applies to employees, contractors, consultants, temporaries,
and other workers at Data Migrators, including all personnel
affiliated with third parties. This policy applies to all equipment that
is owned or leased by Data Migrators.

## Policy

### General Use and Ownership 

1.  Data Migrators proprietary information stored on electronic and computing devices whether owned or leased by Data Migrators, the employee or a third party, remains the sole property of Data Migrators. You must ensure through legal or technical means that proprietary information is protected in accordance with the *Data Protection Standard.*

2.  You have a responsibility to promptly report the theft, loss or unauthorized disclosure of Data Migrators proprietary information.

3.  You may access, use or share Data Migrators proprietary information only to the extent it is authorized and necessary to fulfill your assigned job duties.

4.  Employees are responsible for exercising good judgment regarding the reasonableness of personal use. Individual departments are responsible for creating guidelines concerning personal use of Internet/Intranet/Extranet systems. In the absence of such policies, employees should be guided by departmental policies on personal use, and if there is any uncertainty, employees should consult their supervisor or manager. 

5.  For security and network maintenance purposes, authorized individuals within Data Migrators may monitor equipment, systems and network traffic at any time, per Infosec\'s *Audit Policy*. 

6.  Data Migrators reserves the right to audit networks and systems on a periodic basis to ensure compliance with this policy. 

### Security and Proprietary Information

1.  All mobile and computing devices that connect to the
    internal network must comply with the *Minimum Access
    Policy*.

2.  System level and user level passwords must comply with the
    *Password Policy*. Providing access to another individual,
    either deliberately or through failure to secure its access,
    is prohibited.

3.  All computing devices must be secured with a
    password-protected screensaver with the automatic activation
    feature set to 10 minutes or less. You must lock the screen
    or log off when the device is unattended.

4.  Postings by employees from a Data Migrators email address
    to newsgroups should contain a disclaimer stating that the
    opinions expressed are strictly their own and not
    necessarily those of Data Migrators, unless posting is in
    the course of business duties.

5.  Employees must use extreme caution when opening e-mail
    attachments received from unknown senders, which may contain
    malware.

### Unacceptable Use

The following activities are, in general, prohibited. Employees may be
exempted from these restrictions during the course of their legitimate
job responsibilities (e.g., systems administration staff may have a need
to disable the network access of a host if that host is disrupting
production services).

Under no circumstances is an employee of Data Migrators authorized to
engage in any activity that is illegal under local, state, federal or
international law while utilizing Data Migrators-owned resources.

The lists below are by no means exhaustive, but attempt to provide a
framework for activities which fall into the category of unacceptable
use.

### System and Network Activities

The following activities are strictly prohibited, with no exceptions:

1.  Violations of the rights of any person or company protected by
    copyright, trade secret, patent or other intellectual property, or

    products that are not appropriately licensed for use by Data Migrators.

2.  Unauthorized copying of copyrighted material including, but not
    limited to, digitization and distribution of photographs from
    magazines, books or other copyrighted sources, copyrighted music,
    and the installation of any copyrighted software for which Data Migrators
    or the end user does not have an active license is strictly
    prohibited.

    conducting Data Migrators business, even if you have authorized
    access, is prohibited.

4.  Exporting software, technical information, encryption software or
    technology, in violation of international or regional export control
    laws, is illegal. The appropriate management should be consulted

5.  Introduction of malicious programs into the network or server (e.g.,
    viruses, worms, Trojan horses, e-mail bombs, etc.).

6.  Revealing your account password to others or allowing use of your
    account by others. This includes family and other household members
    when work is being done at home.

    from any Data Migrators account.

    or account.

17. Providing information about, or lists of, Data Migrators employees
    to parties outside Data Migrators.

### Email and Communication Activities

When using company resources to access and use the Internet, users must
realize they represent the company. Whenever employees state an
affiliation to the company, they must also clearly indicate that "the
opinions expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the
company". Questions may be addressed to the IT Department

    mail" or other advertising material to individuals who did not

    through language, frequency, or size of messages.

    numbers of Usenet newsgroups (newsgroup spam).

### Blogging and Social Media

1.  Blogging by employees, whether using Data Migrators' property and
    systems or personal computer systems, is also subject to the terms
    and restrictions set forth in this Policy. Limited and occasional
    use of Data Migrators' systems to engage in blogging is
    acceptable, provided that it is done in a professional and
    responsible manner, does not otherwise violate Data Migrators'
    policy, is not detrimental to Data Migrators' best interests,
    and does not interfere with an employee\'s regular work duties.
    Blogging from Data Migrators' systems is also subject to
    monitoring. 

2.  Data Migrators' Confidential Information policy also applies to
     blogging. As such, Employees are prohibited from revealing any
     Data Migrators confidential or proprietary information, trade secrets
     or any other material covered by Data Migrators' Confidential
     Information policy when engaged in blogging.

3.  Employees shall not engage in any blogging that may harm or tarnish
    the image, reputation and/or goodwill of Data Migrators and/or
    any of its employees. Employees are also prohibited from making
    any discriminatory, disparaging, defamatory or harassing comments
    when blogging or otherwise engaging in any conduct prohibited by
    Data Migrators' *Non-Discrimination and Anti-Harassment*
    policy.

4.  Employees may also not attribute personal statements, opinions or
    beliefs to Data Migrators when engaged in blogging. If an
    employee is expressing his or her beliefs and/or opinions in
    blogs, the employee may not, expressly or implicitly, represent
    themselves as an employee or representative of Data Migrators.
    Employees assume any and all risk associated with blogging.

5.  Apart from following all laws pertaining to the handling and
    disclosure of copyrighted or export controlled materials,
