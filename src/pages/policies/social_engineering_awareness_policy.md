## Overview

The Social Engineering Awareness Policy bundle is a collection of
policies and guidelines for employees of Data Migrators. This Employee
Front Desk Communication Policy is part of the Social Engineering Awareness
Policy bundle.

In order to protect Data Migrators' assets, all employees need to
defend the integrity and confidentiality of Data Migrators'
resources.

## Purpose

This policy has two purposes:

To make employees aware that (a) fraudulent social engineering
attacks occur, and (b) there are procedures that employees can use to
detect attacks.

- Employees are made aware of techniques used for such attacks,
and they are given standard procedures to respond to attacks.

- Employees know who to contact in these circumstances.

- Employees recognize they are an important part of Data Migrators' security. 
  The integrity of an employee is the best line of defense for protecting
  sensitive information regarding Data Migrators' resources.

To create specific procedures for employees to follow to help them
make the best choice when:

- Someone is contacting the employee - via phone, in person,
  email, fax or online - and elusively trying to collect Data Migrators'
  sensitive information.

- The employee is being "socially pressured" or "socially
  encouraged or tricked" into sharing sensitive data.

## Scope

Includes all employees of Data Migrators, including temporary
contractors or part-time employees participating with help desk customer
service.

## Policy

Sensitive information of Data Migrators will not be shared
with an unauthorized individual if they use words and/or
techniques such as the following:

- An "urgent matter"
- A "forgotten password"
- A "computer virus emergency"
 -Any form of intimidation from "higher level management"
- Any "name dropping" by the individual which gives the
appearance that it is coming from legitimate and authorized
personnel.
- The requester requires release of information that will
reveal passwords, model, serial number, or brand or quantity
of Data Migrators resources.
- The techniques are used by an unknown (not promptly
verifiable) individual via phone, email, online, fax, or in
person.
- The techniques are used by a person that declares to be
"affiliated" with Data Migrators such as a
sub-contractor.
- The techniques are used by an individual that says he/she is
a reporter for a well-known press editor or TV or radio
company.
- The requester is using ego and vanity seducing methods, for
example, rewarding the front desk employee with compliments
about his/her intelligence, capabilities, or making
inappropriate greetings (coming from a stranger).
