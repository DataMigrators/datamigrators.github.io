Allowing employees to install software on company computing devices
opens the organization up to unnecessary exposure. Conflicting file
versions or DLLs which can prevent programs from running, the
introduction of malware from infected installation software, unlicensed
software which could be discovered during audit, and programs which can
be used to hack the organization's network are examples of the problems
that can be introduced when employees install software on company
equipment.
