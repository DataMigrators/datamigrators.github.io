## Overview

Removable media is a well-known source of malware infections and has
been directly tied to the loss of sensitive information in many
organizations.

## Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to minimize the risk of loss or exposure
of sensitive information maintained by Data Migrators and to reduce
the risk of acquiring malware infections on computers operated by
Data Migrators.

## Scope

This policy covers all computers and servers operating in Data Migrators.

## Policy

Data Migrators staff may only use Data Migrators removable media in
their work computers. Data Migratorsremovable media may not be
connected to or used in computers that are not owned or leased by the
Data Migrators without explicit permission of the Data Migrators
InfoSec staff. Sensitive information should be stored on removable media
only when required in the performance of your assigned duties or when
providing information required by other state or federal agencies. When
sensitive information is stored on removable media, it must be encrypted
in accordance with the Data Migrators *Acceptable Encryption Policy*.

Exceptions to this policy may be requested on a case-by-case basis by
Data Migrators-exception procedures.

## Policy Compliance

### Compliance Measurement

methods, including but not limited to, periodic walk-thrus, video
monitoring, business tool reports, internal and external audits, and
