## Overview

Recommended processes to prevent virus problems:

-   Always run the Corporate standard, supported anti-virus software is
    available from the corporate download site. Download and run the
    current version; download and install anti-virus software updates as
    they become available.

-   NEVER open any files or macros attached to an email from an unknown,
    suspicious or untrustworthy source. Delete these attachments
    immediately, then "double delete" them by emptying your Trash.

-   Delete spam, chain, and other junk email without forwarding, in with
    Data Migrators' *Acceptable Use Policy*.

-   Never download files from unknown or suspicious sources.

-   Avoid direct disk sharing with read/write access unless there is
    absolutely a business requirement to do so.

-   Always scan a floppy diskette from an unknown source for viruses
    before using it.

-   Back-up critical data and system configurations on a regular basis
    and store the data in a safe place.

-   If lab testing conflicts with anti-virus software, run the
    anti-virus utility to ensure a clean machine, disable the software,
    then run the lab test. After the lab test, enable the anti-virus
    software. When the anti-virus software is disabled, do not run any
    applications that could transfer a virus, e.g., email or file
    sharing.

-   New viruses are discovered almost every day. Periodically check the
    *Lab Anti-Virus Policy* and this Recommended Processes list for
    updates.
