data network of Data Migrators.

5.  The security features necessary to minimize risks to
    communication equipment must be configured in the equipment
    before it is placed into service. There are two possible roles
    for the staff that manages the communication equipment:
    monitoring and administrator. The monitoring role has read only
    privileges. The administrator role is able to change
    configuration parameters. All issued commands by users will be
    recorded, as well as any other security events that may pose a
    threat to the equipment.

6.  Local users are not allowed on communication equipment. Everyone
    must authenticate through the central repository of users using
    a protocol that reduces the risk of identity theft.

7.  All information transmitted from the device must be encrypted by
    a strong encryption algorithm to minimize the risks of
    eavesdropping on the communications and man-in-the-middle
    attacks.

8.  The events recorded by the communication equipment must be kept
    in storage media that is subject to a regular backup process.
    The process of maintaining these backups must ensure that the
    information is not amended.

9.  The password of the communication equipment\'s administrator
    user must not be known by anyone on the staff that manages the
    equipment. If, for any reason, it is necessary to make use of
    the highest administrative privileges within the device, then
    the staff must file a request to the internal security division
    for the password attaching the justification for its use and
    completing the required forms. The password must then be reset
    by the highest administrator to maintain security.
