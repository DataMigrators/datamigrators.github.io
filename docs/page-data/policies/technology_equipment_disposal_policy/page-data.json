Proper disposal of equipment is both environmentally responsible\nand often required by law. In addition, hard drives, USB drives, CD-ROMs\nand other storage media contain various kinds of Data Migrators data,\nsome of which is considered sensitive. In order to protect our\nconstituent's data, all storage mediums must be properly erased before\nbeing disposed of. However, simply deleting or even formatting data is\nnot considered sufficient. When deleting files or formatting a device,\ndata is marked for deletion, but is still accessible until being\noverwritten by a new file. Therefore, special tools must be used to\nsecurely erase data prior to equipment disposal.\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this policy it to define the guidelines for the disposal\nof technology equipment and components owned by Data Migrators.\n\n## Scope\n\nThis policy applies to any computer/technology equipment or peripheral\ndevices that are no longer needed within Data Migrators including, but\nnot limited to the following:  personal computers, servers, hard drives,\nlaptops, mainframes, smart phones, or handheld computers ( i.e., Windows\nMobile, iOS or Android-based devices), peripherals (i.e., keyboards,\nmice, speakers), printers, scanners, typewriters, compact and floppy\ndiscs, portable storage devices (i.e., USB drives), backup tapes,\nprinted materials.\n\nAll Data Migrators employees and affiliates must comply with this\npolicy.\n\n## Policy\n\n### Technology Equipment Disposal\n\n1.  When Technology assets have reached the end of their useful\n    life they should be sent to the Equipment Disposal Team\n    office for proper disposal.\n\n2.  The Equipment Disposal Team will securely erase all\n    storage mediums in accordance with current industry best\n    practices.\n\n3.  All data including, all files and licensed software shall be\n    removed from equipment using disk sanitizing software that\n    cleans the media overwriting each and every disk sector of\n    the machine with zero-filled blocks, meeting Department of\n    Defense standards.\n\n4.  No computer or technology equipment may be sold to any\n    individual other than through the processes identified in\n    this policy (Section 4.2 below).\n\n5.  No computer equipment should be disposed of via skips,\n    dumps, landfill etc. Electronic recycling bins may be\n    periodically placed in locations around Data Migrators.\n    These can be used to dispose of equipment. The Equipment\n    Disposal Team will properly remove all data prior to final\n    disposal.\n\n6.  All electronic drives must be degaussed or overwritten with\n    a commercially available disk cleaning program. Hard drives\n    may also be removed and rendered unreadable (drilling,\n    crushing or other demolition methods).\n\n7.  Computer Equipment refers to desktop, laptop, tablet or\n    netbook computers, printers, copiers, monitors, servers,\n    handheld devices, telephones, cell phones, disc drives or\n    any storage device, network switches, routers, wireless\n    access points, batteries, backup tapes, etc.\n\n8.  The Equipment Disposal Team will place a sticker on the\n    equipment case indicating the disk wipe has been performed.\n    The sticker will include the date and the initials of the\n    technician who performed the disk wipe.\n\n9.  Technology equipment with non-functioning memory or storage\n    technology will have the memory or storage device removed\n    and it will be physically destroyed.\n\n### Employee Purchase of Disposed Equipment\n\n1.  Equipment which is working, but reached the end of its\n    useful life to Data Migrators, will be made available for\n    purchase by employees.\n\n2.  A lottery system will be used to determine who has the\n    opportunity to purchase available equipment.\n\n3.  All equipment purchases must go through the lottery process.\n    Employees cannot purchase their office computer directly or\n    \"reserve\" a system. This ensures that all employees have an\n    equal chance of obtaining equipment.\n\n4.  Finance and Information Technology will determine an\n    appropriate cost for each item.\n\n5.  All purchases are final. No warranty or support will be\n    provided with any equipment sold.\n\n6.  Any equipment not in working order or remaining from the\n    lottery process will be donated or disposed of according to\n    current environmental guidelines. Information\n\n7.  Technology has contracted with several organizations to\n    donate or properly dispose of outdated technology assets.\n\n8.  Prior to leaving Data Migrators premises, all equipment\n    must be removed from the Information Technology inventory\n    system.\n\n## Policy Compliance\n\n### Compliance Measurement\n\nThe Infosec team will verify compliance to this policy through various\nmethods, including but not limited to, business tool reports, internal\nand external audits, and feedback to the policy owner.\n\n## Exceptions\n\nAny exception to the policy must be approved by the Infosec Team in\nadvance.\n\n## Non-Compliance\n\nAn employee found to have violated this policy may be subject to\ndisciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.\n\n## Related Documents\n\nNone.\n\n## Definitions and Terms\n\nNone.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"ec52f6ae98bd276a9e3b30bbe1d4b1eb","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":319},"frontmatter":{"title":"Technology Equipment Disposal Policy","description":"Data Migrators' policy on technology equipment disposal","keywords":"ibm,carbon,gatsby,mdx,markdown"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Technology Equipment Disposal Policy\ndescription: Data Migrators' policy on technology equipment disposal\nkeywords: 'ibm,carbon,gatsby,mdx,markdown'\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nThis page describes Data Migrators' policy on technology equipment disposal.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n  <AnchorLink>Overview</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Purpose</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Scope</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Policy</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Policy Compliance</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Exceptions</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Non-compliance</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Related Documents</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Definitions and Terms</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## Overview\n\nTechnology equipment often contains parts which cannot simply be thrown\naway.
