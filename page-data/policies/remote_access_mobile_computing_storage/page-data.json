These devices are especially susceptible to loss,\ntheft, hacking, and the distribution of malicious software because they\nare easily portable and can be used anywhere. As mobile computing\nbecomes more widely used, it is necessary to address security to protect\ninformation resources at the Data Migrators.\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this policy is to establish an authorized method for\ncontrolling mobile computing and storage devices that contain or access\ninformation resources at the Data Migrators.\n\n## Scope\n\nData Migrators employees, consultants, vendors, contractors, and others\nwho use mobile computing and storage devices on the network\nat the Data Migrators.\n\n## Policy\n\n### General Policy\n\nIt is the policy of the Data Migrators that mobile computing and\nstorage devices containing or accessing the information resources at the\nData Migrators must be approved prior to connecting to the information\nsystems at the Data Migrators. This pertains to all devices connecting\nto the network at the Data Migrators, regardless of ownership.\n\nMobile computing and storage devices include, but are not limited to:\nlaptop computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), plug-ins,\nUniversal Serial Bus (USB) port devices, Compact Discs (CDs), Digital\nVersatile Discs (DVDs), flash drives, modems, handheld wireless devices,\nwireless networking cards, and any other existing or future mobile\ncomputing or storage device, either personally owned or Data Migrators\nowned, that may connect to or access the information systems at\nthe Data Migrators. A risk analysis for each new media type shall be\nconducted and documented prior to its use or connection to the network\nat the Data Migrators unless the media type has already been approved\nby the Desktop Standards Committee. The Desktop Standards Committee will\nmaintain a list of approved mobile computing and storage devices.\n\nMobile computing and storage devices are easily lost or stolen,\npresenting a high risk for unauthorized access and introduction of\nmalicious software to the network at the Data Migrators. These risks\nmust be mitigated to acceptable levels.\n\nPortable computing devices and portable electronic storage media that\ncontain confidential, personal, or sensitive Data Migrators\ninformation must use encryption or equally strong measures to protect\nthe data while it is being stored.\n\nUnless written approval has been obtained from the Data Resource Manager\nand Chief Information Security Officer, databases or portions thereof,\nwhich reside on the network at the Data Migrators, shall not be\ndownloaded to mobile computing or storage devices.\n\n### Procedures\n\nTo report lost or stolen mobile computing and storage devices, call the\nEnterprise Help Desk. For further procedures on lost or stolen handheld\nwireless devices, please see the Procedures section.\n\nThe Data Migrators Desktop Standards Committee shall approve all new\nmobile computing and storage devices that may connect to information\nsystems at the Data Migrators.\n\nAny non-departmental owned device that may connect to the Data Migrators\nnetwork must first be approved by technical personnel such as\nthose from the Data Migrators Desktop Support. Refer to the Mobile\nMedia Standards for detailed information.\n\n### Roles & Responsibilities\n\nUsers of mobile computing and storage devices must diligently protect\nsuch devices from loss of equipment and disclosure of private\ninformation belonging to or maintained by the Data Migrators. Before\nconnecting a mobile computing or storage device to the network at\nData Migrators, users must ensure it is on the list of approved\ndevices issued by the ISD.\n\nThe Enterprise Help Desk must be notified immediately upon detection of\na security incident, especially when a mobile device may have been lost\nor stolen.\n\nThe Infosec Team is responsible for the mobile device policy at the\nData Migrators and shall conduct a risk analysis to document\nsafeguards for each media type to be used on the network or on equipment\nowned by the Data Migrators.\n\nThe Information Systems Division (ISD) is responsible for developing\nprocedures for implementing this policy. The Desktop Standards Committee\nwill maintain a list of approved mobile computing and storage devices\nand will make the list available on the intranet.\n\n## Policy Compliance\n\n### Compliance Measurement\n\nThe Infosec team will verify compliance to this policy through various\nmethods, including but not limited to, periodic walk-thrus, video\nmonitoring, business tool reports, internal and external audits, and\nfeedback to the policy owner.\n\n## Exceptions\n\nAny exception to the policy must be approved by the Infosec team in\nadvance.\n\n## Non-Compliance\n\nAn employee found to have violated this policy may be subject to\ndisciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.\n\n## Related Standards, Policies and Processes\n\nNone.\n\n## Definitions and Terms\n\nThe following definition and terms can be found in the [SANS Glossary](https://www.sans.org/security-resources/glossary-of-terms/):\n\n-   Flash Drive\n-   Mobile Device\n-   Plug-in\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"0d3c044c6bc972808cbe106782be9c6e","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":340},"frontmatter":{"title":"Remote Access Mobile Computing Storage Policy","description":"Usage instructions for the Markdown component","keywords":"ibm,carbon,gatsby,mdx,markdown"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Remote Access Mobile Computing Storage Policy\ndescription: Usage instructions for the Markdown component\nkeywords: 'ibm,carbon,gatsby,mdx,markdown'\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nThis page describes Data Migrators' policy on remote access mobile computing storage.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n  <AnchorLink>Overview</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Purpose</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Scope</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Policy</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Policy Compliance</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Exceptions</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Non-compliance</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Related Documents</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Definitions and Terms</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## Overview\n\nWith advances in computer technology, mobile computing and storage\ndevices have become useful tools to meet the business needs at the\nData Migrators.
