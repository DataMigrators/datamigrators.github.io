While these remote\nnetworks are beyond the control of Hypergolic Reactions, LLC policy, we\nmust mitigate these external risks the best of our ability.\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this policy is to define rules and requirements for\nconnecting to Data Migrators\\'s network from any host. These rules and\nrequirements are designed to minimize the potential exposure to\nData Migrators from damages which may result from unauthorized use of\nData Migrators resources. Damages include the loss of sensitive or\ncompany confidential data, intellectual property, damage to public\nimage, damage to critical Data Migrators internal systems, and fines\nor other financial liabilities incurred as a result of those losses.\n\n## Scope\n\nThis policy applies to all Data Migrators employees, contractors,\nvendors and agents with a Data Migrators-owned or personally-owned\ncomputer or workstation used to connect to the Data Migrators network.\nThis policy applies to remote access connections used to do work on\nbehalf of Data Migrators, including reading or sending email and\nviewing intranet web resources. This policy covers any and all technical\nimplementations of remote access used to connect to Data Migrators\nnetworks.\n\n## Policy\n\nIt is the responsibility of Data Migrators employees, contractors,\nvendors and agents with remote access privileges to Data Migrators\\'s\ncorporate network to ensure that their remote access connection is given\nthe same consideration as the user\\'s on-site connection to Data Migrators.\n\nGeneral access to the Internet for recreational use through the\nData Migrators network is strictly limited to Data Migrators\nemployees, contractors, vendors and agents (hereafter referred to as\n\"Authorized Users\"). When accessing the Data Migrators network from a\npersonal computer, Authorized Users are responsible for preventing\naccess to any Data Migrators computer resources or data by\nnon-Authorized Users. Performance of illegal activities through the\nData Migrators network by any user (Authorized or otherwise) is\nprohibited. The Authorized User bears responsibility for and\nconsequences of misuse of the Authorized User's access. For further\ninformation and definitions, see the *Acceptable Use Policy*.\n\nAuthorized Users will not use Data Migrators networks to access the\nInternet for outside business interests.\n\nFor additional information regarding Data Migrators\\'s remote access\nconnection options, including how to obtain a remote access login, free\nanti-virus software, troubleshooting, etc., go to the Remote Access\nServices website (company url).\n\n### Requirements\n\n1.  Secure remote access must be strictly controlled with encryption\n    (i.e., Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)) and strong pass-phrases.\n    For further information see the *Acceptable Encryption Policy*\n    and the *Password Policy*.\n\n2.  Authorized Users shall protect their login and password, even\n    from family members.\n\n3.  While using a Data Migrators-owned computer to remotely\n    connect to Data Migrators\\'s corporate network, Authorized\n    Users shall ensure the remote host is not connected to any other\n    network at the same time, with the exception of personal\n    networks that are under their complete control or under the\n    complete control of an Authorized User or Third Party.\n\n4.  Use of external resources to conduct Data Migrators business\n    must be approved in advance by InfoSec and the appropriate\n    business unit manager.\n\n5.  All hosts that are connected to Data Migrators internal\n    networks via remote access technologies must use the most\n    up-to-date anti-virus software (place url to corporate software\n    site here), this includes personal computers. Third party\n    connections must comply with requirements as stated in the\n    *Third Party Agreement*.\n\n6.  Personal equipment used to connect to Data Migrators'\n    networks must meet the requirements of Data Migrators-owned\n    equipment for remote access as stated in the Hardware and\n    Software Configuration Standards for Remote Access to Data Migrators Networks.\n\n\n## Policy Compliance\n\n### Compliance Measurement\n\nThe Infosec Team will verify compliance to this policy through various\nmethods, including but not limited to, periodic walk-thrus, video\nmonitoring, business tool reports, internal and external audits, and\ninspection, and will provide feedback to the policy owner and\nappropriate business unit manager.\n\n## Exceptions\n\nAny exception to the policy must be approved by Remote Access Services\nand the Infosec Team in advance.\n\n## Non-Compliance\n\nAn employee found to have violated this policy may be subject to\ndisciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.\n\n## Related Documents\n\nPlease review the following policies for details of protecting\ninformation when accessing the corporate network via remote access\nmethods, and acceptable use of Data Migrators's network:\n\n- Acceptable Encryption Policy\n- Acceptable Use Policy\n- Password Policy\n- Third Party Agreement\n- Hardware and Software Configuration Standards for Remote Access to Data Migrators Networks\n\n## Definitions and Terms\n\nNone.","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"211b23430972918afbc5401ed4756cc7","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":338},"frontmatter":{"title":"Remote Access Policy","description":"Usage instructions for the Markdown component","keywords":"ibm,carbon,gatsby,mdx,markdown"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Remote Access Policy\ndescription: Usage instructions for the Markdown component\nkeywords: 'ibm,carbon,gatsby,mdx,markdown'\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nThis page describes Data Migrators' policy around the use of enryption algorithms.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n  <AnchorLink>Overview</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Purpose</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Scope</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Policy</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Policy Compliance</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Exceptions</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Non-compliance</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Related Documents</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Definitions and Terms</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## Overview\n\nRemote access to our corporate network is essential to maintain our\nTeam's productivity, but in many cases this remote access originates\nfrom networks that may already be compromised or are at a significantly\nlower security posture than our corporate network.
