This policy applies to Data Migrators\nowned and managed labs, including labs outside the corporate firewall\n(DMZ).\n\n## Policy\n\n### General Requirements\n\n5.  Lab owning organizations are responsible for assigning lab\n    managers, a point of contact (POC), and a back-up POC for\n    each lab. Lab owners must maintain up-to-date POC\n    information with InfoSec and the Corporate Enterprise\n    Management Team. Lab managers or their backup must be\n    available around-the-clock for emergencies, otherwise\n    actions will be taken without their involvement.\n\n6.  Lab managers are responsible for the security of their labs\n    and the lab's impact on the corporate production network\n    and any other networks. Lab managers are responsible for\n    adherence to this policy and associated processes. Where\n    policies and procedures are undefined lab managers must do\n    their best to safeguard Data Migrators from security\n    vulnerabilities.\n\n7.  Lab managers are responsible for the lab's compliance with\n    all Data Migrators security policies.\n\n8.  The Lab Manager is responsible for controlling lab access.\n    Access to any given lab will only be granted by the lab\n    manager or designee, to those individuals with an immediate\n    business need within the lab, either short-term or as\n    defined by their ongoing job function. This includes\n    continually monitoring the access list to ensure that those\n    who no longer require access to the lab have their access\n    terminated.\n\n9.  All user passwords must comply with Data Migrators'\n    [Password Construction Guidelines](password_construction_guidelines).\n\n10. Individual user accounts on any lab device must be deleted\n    when no longer authorized within three (3) days. Group\n    account passwords on lab computers (Unix, windows, etc) must\n    be changed quarterly (once every 3 months).\n\n11. PC-based lab computers must have Data Migrators'\n    standard, supported anti-virus software installed and\n    scheduled to run at regular intervals. In addition, the\n    anti-virus software and the virus pattern files must be kept\n    up-to-date. Virus-infected computers must be removed from\n    the network until they are verified as virus-free. Lab\n    Admins/Lab Managers are responsible for creating procedures\n    that ensure anti-virus software is run at regular intervals,\n    and computers are verified as virus-free.\n\n12. Any activities with the intention to create and/or\n    distribute malicious programs into Data Migrators'\n    networks (e.g., viruses, worms, Trojan horses, e-mail bombs,\n    etc.) are prohibited, in accordance with the [Acceptable Use\n    Policy](acceptable_use_policy).\n\n13. No lab shall provide production services. Production\n    services are defined as ongoing and shared business critical\n    services that generate revenue streams or provide customer\n    capabilities. These should be managed by a external support organization.\n\n14. In accordance with *the Data Classification Policy*,\n    information that is marked as Data Migrators Highly\n    Confidential or Data Migrators Restricted is prohibited on\n    lab equipment.\n\n15. Immediate access to equipment and system logs must be\n    granted to members of InfoSec and the Network Support\n    Organization upon request, in accordance with the *Audit\n    Policy*.\n\n16. InfoSec will address non-compliance waiver requests on a\n    case-by-case basis and approve waivers if justified.\n\n### Internal Lab Security Requirements\n\n5.  The Network Support Organization must maintain a firewall\n    device between the corporate production network and all lab\n    equipment.\n\n6.  The Network Support Organization and/or InfoSec reserve the\n    right to interrupt lab connections that impact the corporate\n    production network negatively or pose a security risk.\n\n7.  The Network Support Organization must record all lab IP\n    addresses, which are routed within Data Migrators\n    networks, in Enterprise Address Management database along\n    with current contact information for that lab.\n\n8.  Any lab that wants to add an external connection must\n    provide a diagram and documentation to InfoSec with business\n    justification, the equipment, and the IP address space\n    information. InfoSec will review for security concerns and\n    must approve before such connections are implemented.\n\n9.  All traffic between the corporate production and the lab\n    network must go through a Network Support Organization\n    maintained firewall. Lab network devices (including\n    wireless) must not cross-connect the lab and production\n    networks.\n\n10. Original firewall configurations and any changes thereto\n    must be reviewed and approved by InfoSec. InfoSec may\n    require security improvements as needed.\n\n11. Labs are prohibited from engaging in port scanning, network\n    auto-discovery, traffic spamming/flooding, and other similar\n    activities that negatively impact the corporate network\n    and/or non-Data Migrators networks. These activities must\n    be restricted within the lab.\n\n12. Traffic between production networks and lab networks, as\n    well as traffic between separate lab networks, is permitted\n    based on business needs and as long as the traffic does not\n    negatively impact on other networks. Labs must not advertise\n    network services that may compromise production network\n    services or put lab confidential information at risk.\n\n13. InfoSec reserves the right to audit all lab-related data and\n    administration processes at any time, including but not\n    limited to, inbound and outbound packets, firewalls and\n    network peripherals.\n\n14. Lab owned gateway devices are required to comply with all\n    Data Migrators product security advisories and must\n    authenticate against the Corporate Authentication servers.\n\n15. The enable password for all lab owned gateway devices must\n    be different from all other equipment passwords in the lab.\n    The password must be in accordance with Data Migrators'\n    [Password Protection Policy](password_protection_policy) and\n    [Password Construction Guidelines](password_construction_guidelines).\n    The password will only be provided to\n    those who are authorized to administer the lab network.\n\n16. In labs where non-Data Migrators personnel have physical\n    access (e.g., training labs), direct connectivity to the\n    corporate production network is not allowed. Additionally,\n    no Data Migrators confidential information can reside on\n    any computer equipment in these labs. Connectivity for\n    authorized personnel from these labs can be allowed to the\n    corporate production network only if authenticated against\n    the Corporate Authentication servers, temporary access lists\n    (lock and key), SSH, client VPNs, or similar technology\n    approved by InfoSec.\n\n17. Lab networks with external connections are prohibited from\n    connecting to the corporate production network or other\n    internal networks through a direct connection, wireless\n    connection, or other computing equipment.\n\n### DMZ Lab Security Requirements\n\n1.  New DMZ labs require a business justification and VP-level\n    approval from the business unit. Changes to the connectivity\n    or purpose of an existing DMZ lab must be reviewed and\n    approved by the InfoSec Team.\n\n2.  DMZ labs must be in a physically separate room, cage, or\n    secured lockable rack with limited access. In addition, the\n    Lab Manager must maintain a list of who has access to the\n    equipment.\n\n3.  DMZ lab POCs must maintain network devices deployed in the\n    DMZ lab up to the network support organization point of\n    demarcation.\n\n4.  DMZ labs must not connect to corporate internal networks,\n    either directly, logically (for example, IPSEC tunnel),\n    through a wireless connection, or multi-homed machine.\n\n5.  An approved network support organization must maintain a\n    firewall device between the DMZ lab and the Internet.\n    Firewall devices must be configured based on least privilege\n    access principles and the DMZ lab business requirements.\n    Original firewall configurations and subsequent changes must\n    be reviewed and approved by the InfoSec Team. All traffic\n    between the DMZ lab and the Internet must go through the\n    approved firewall. Cross-connections that bypass the\n    firewall device are strictly prohibited.\n\n6.  All routers and switches not used for testing and/or\n    training must conform to the [DMZ\n    Router](http://wwwin.cisco.com/infosec/guidelines/iosrouter.shtml)\n    and [Switch standardization\n    documents](http://ens-sj1.cisco.com/ISNETWORK/isg/ethernet/).\n\n7.  Operating systems of all hosts internal to the DMZ lab\n    running Internet Services must be configured to the secure\n    host installation and configuration standards published the\n    InfoSec Team.\n\n8.  Remote administration must be performed over secure channels\n    (for example, encrypted network connections using SSH or\n    IPSEC) or console access independent from the DMZ networks.\n\n9.  DMZ lab devices must not be an open proxy to the Internet.\n\n10. The Network Support Organization and InfoSec reserve the\n    right to interrupt lab connections if a security concern\n    exists.\n\n## Policy Compliance\n\n### Compliance Measurement\n\nThe Infosec team will verify compliance to this policy through various\nmethods, including but not limited to, periodic walk-thrus, video\nmonitoring, business tool reports, internal and external audits, and\nfeedback to the policy owner.\n\n## Exceptions\n\nAny exception to the policy must be approved by the Infosec Team in\nadvance.\n\n## Non-Compliance\n\nAn employee found to have violated this policy may be subject to\ndisciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.\n\n## Related Documents\n\n-   Audit Policy\n\n-   Acceptable Use Policy\n\n-   Data Classification Policy\n\n-   Password Policy\n\n## Definitions and Terms\n\nThe following definition and terms can be found in the [SANS Glossary](https://www.sans.org/security-resources/glossary-of-terms/):\n\n-   DMZ\n-   Firewall\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"103e03617f06452ead1a75fbba79e7f0","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":326},"frontmatter":{"title":"Lab Security Policy","description":"Usage instructions for the lab security","keywords":"ibm,carbon,gatsby,mdx,markdown"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Lab Security Policy\ndescription: Usage instructions for the lab security\nkeywords: 'ibm,carbon,gatsby,mdx,markdown'\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nThis page describes Data Migrators' policy on lab security\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n  <AnchorLink>Overview</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Purpose</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Scope</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Policy</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Policy Compliance</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Exceptions</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Non-compliance</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Related Documents</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Definitions and Terms</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## Overview\n\nSee Purpose.\n\n## Purpose\n\nThis policy establishes the information security requirements to help\nmanage and safeguard lab resources and Data Migrators networks by\nminimizing the exposure of critical infrastructure and information\nassets to threats that may result from unprotected hosts and\nunauthorized access.\n\n## Scope\n\nThis policy applies to all employees, contractors, consultants,\ntemporary and other workers at Data Migrators and its subsidiaries\nmust adhere to this policy.
