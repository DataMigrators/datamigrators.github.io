However, incorrect use,\nstorage and transmission of such credentials could lead to compromise of\nvery sensitive assets and be a springboard to wider compromise within\nthe organization.\n\n## Purpose\n\nThis policy states the requirements for securely storing and retrieving\ndatabase usernames and passwords (i.e., database credentials) for use by\na program that will access a database running on one of Data Migrators\\'s networks.\n\nSoftware applications running on Data Migrators' networks may\nrequire access to one of the many internal database servers. In order to\naccess these databases, a program must authenticate to the database by\npresenting acceptable credentials. If the credentials are improperly\nstored, the credentials may be compromised leading to a compromise of\nthe database.\n\n## Scope\n\nThis policy is directed at all system implementer and/or software\nengineers who may be coding applications that will access a production\ndatabase server on the Data Migrators Network. This policy applies to\nall software (programs, modules, libraries or APIS that will access a\nData Migrators, multi-user production database. It is recommended that\nsimilar requirements be in place for non-production servers and lap\nenvironments since they don't always use sanitized information.\n\n## Policy\n\n### General\n\nIn order to maintain the security of Data Migrators' internal\ndatabases, access by software programs must be granted only after\nauthentication with credentials. The credentials used for this\nauthentication must not reside in the main, executing body of the\nprogram\\'s source code in clear text. Database credentials must not be\nstored in a location that can be accessed through a web server.\n\n### Specific Requirements\n\nStorage of Data Base User Names and Passwords\n\n-   Database user names and passwords may be stored in a file separate\n    from the executing body of the program\\'s code. This file must not\n    be world readable or writeable.\n\n-   Database credentials may reside on the database server. In this\n    case, a hash function number identifying the credentials may be\n    stored in the executing body of the program\\'s code.\n\n-   Database credentials may be stored as part of an authentication\n    server (i.e., an entitlement directory), such as an LDAP server used\n    for user authentication. Database authentication may occur on behalf\n    of a program as part of the user authentication process at the\n    authentication server. In this case, there is no need for\n    programmatic use of database credentials.\n\n-   Database credentials may not reside in the documents tree of a web\n    server.\n\n-   Pass through authentication (i.e., Oracle OPS\\$ authentication) must\n    not allow access to the database based solely upon a remote user\\'s\n    authentication on the remote host.\n\n-   Passwords or pass phrases used to access a database must adhere to\n    the *Password Policy*.\n\n### Retrieval of Database User Names and Passwords\n\n-   If stored in a file that is not source code, then database user\n    names and passwords must be read from the file immediately prior\n    to use. Immediately following database authentication, the memory\n    containing the user name and password must be released or cleared.\n\n-   The scope into which you may store database credentials must be\n    physically separated from the other areas of your code, e.g., the\n    credentials must be in a separate source file. The file that\n    contains the credentials must contain no other code but the\n    credentials (i.e., the user name and password) and any functions,\n    routines, or methods that will be used to access the credentials.\n\n-   For languages that execute from source code, the credentials\\'\n    source file must not reside in the same browseable or executable\n    file directory tree in which the executing body of code resides.\n\n### Access to Database User Names and Passwords\n\n-   Every program or every collection of programs implementing a single\n    business function must have unique database credentials. Sharing of\n    credentials between programs is not allowed.\n\n-   Database passwords used by programs are system-level passwords as\n    defined by the *Password Policy*.\n\n-   Developer groups must have a process in place to ensure that\n    database passwords are controlled and changed in accordance with the\n    *Password Policy*. This process must include a method for\n    restricting knowledge of database passwords to a need-to-know basis.\n\n### Techniques for implementing this policy\n\nAll Data Migrators staff should utilise 1Password for gnerating passwords.\n\n## Policy Compliance\n\n### Compliance Measurement\n\nThe Infosec team will verify compliance to this policy through various\nmethods, including but not limited to, business tool reports, internal\nand external audits, and feedback to the policy owner.\n\n## Exceptions\n\nAny exception to the policy must be approved by the Infosec team in\nadvance.\n\n## Non-Compliance\n\nAn employee found to have violated this policy may be subject to\ndisciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.\n\nA violation of this policy by a temporary worker, contractor or vendor\nmay result in the termination of their contract or assignment with\nData Migrators.\n\nAny program code or application that is found to violate this policy\nmust be remediated within a 90 day period.\n\n## Related Documents\n\n-   [Password Policy](password_construction_guidelines)\n\n## Definitions and Terms\n\nThe following definition and terms can be found in the [SANS Glossary](https://www.sans.org/security-resources/glossary-of-terms/):\n\n-   Credentials\n-   Executing Body\n-   Hash Function\n-   LDAP\n-   Module\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"c8297f4d7544c658287242abfffd7bae","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":313},"frontmatter":{"title":"Database Credentials Coding Policy","description":"Usage instructions for the Markdown component","keywords":"ibm,carbon,gatsby,mdx,markdown"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Database Credentials Coding Policy\ndescription: Usage instructions for the Markdown component\nkeywords: 'ibm,carbon,gatsby,mdx,markdown'\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nThis page describes Data Migrators' policy around the coding of database dredentials.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n  <AnchorLink>Overview</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Purpose</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Scope</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Policy</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Policy Compliance</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Exceptions</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Non-compliance</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Related Documents</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Definitions and Terms</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## Overview\n\nDatabase authentication credentials are a necessary part of authorizing\napplication to connect to internal databases.
