Consistent Server installation policies,\nownership and configuration management are all about doing the basics\nwell.\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this policy is to establish standards for the base\nconfiguration of internal server equipment that is owned and/or operated\nby Data Migrators. Effective implementation of this policy will\nminimize unauthorized access to Data Migrators proprietary information\nand technology.\n\n## Scope\n\nAll employees, contractors, consultants, temporary and other workers at\nCisco and its subsidiaries must adhere to this policy. This policy\napplies to server equipment that is owned, operated, or leased by Cisco\nor registered under a Cisco-owned internal network domain.\n\nThis policy specifies requirements for equipment on the internal Cisco\nnetwork. For secure configuration of equipment external to Cisco on the\nDMZ, see the Internet *DMZ Equipment Policy*.\n\n## Policy\n\n### General Requirements\n\nAll internal servers deployed at Data Migrators must be\nowned by an operational group that is responsible for system\nadministration. Approved server configuration guides must be\nestablished and maintained by each operational group, based\non business needs and approved by InfoSec. Operational\ngroups should monitor configuration compliance and implement\nan exception policy tailored to their environment. Each\noperational group must establish a process for changing the\nconfiguration guides, which includes review and approval by\nInfoSec. The following items must be met:\n\nServers must be registered within the corporate enterprise\nmanagement system. At a minimum, the following information is\nrequired to positively identify the point of contact:\n\n-   Server contact(s) and location, and a backup contact\n\n-   Hardware and Operating System/Version\n\n-   Main functions and applications, if applicable\n\nInformation in the corporate enterprise management system must be\nkept up-to-date.\n\nConfiguration changes for production servers must follow the\nappropriate change management procedures.\n\nFor security, compliance, and maintenance purposes, authorized\npersonnel may monitor and audit equipment, systems, processes,\nand network traffic per the *Audit Policy*.\n\n### Configuration Requirements\n\n1. Operating System configuration should be in accordance with\n   approved InfoSec guidelines.\n\n1. Services and applications that will not be used must be\n   disabled where practical.\n\n1. Access to services should be logged and/or protected through\n   access-control methods such as a web application firewall,\n   if possible.\n\n3.  The most recent security patches must be installed on the\n    system as soon as practical, the only exception being when\n    immediate application would interfere with business\n    requirements.\n\n4.  Trust relationships between systems are a security risk, and\n    their use should be avoided. Do not use a trust relationship\n    when some other method of communication is sufficient.\n\n5.  Always use standard security principles of least required\n    access to perform a function. Do not use root when a\n    non-privileged account will do.\n\n6.  If a methodology for secure channel connection is available\n    (i.e., technically feasible), privileged access must be\n    performed over secure channels, (e.g., encrypted network\n    connections using SSH or IPSec).\n\n7.  Servers should be physically located in an access-controlled\n    environment.\n\n8.  Servers are specifically prohibited from operating from\n    uncontrolled cubicle areas.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAll security-related events on critical or sensitive systems\nmust be logged and audit trails saved as follows:\n\n\n-   All security related logs will be kept online for a minimum of 1\n    week.\n\n-   Daily incremental tape backups will be retained for at least 1\n    month.\n\n-   Weekly full tape backups of logs will be retained for at least 1\n    month.\n\n-   Monthly full backups will be retained for a minimum of 2 years.\n\nSecurity-related events will be reported to InfoSec, who will\nreview logs and report incidents to IT management. Corrective\nmeasures will be prescribed as needed. Security-related events\ninclude, but are not limited to:\n\n\n-   Port-scan attacks\n\n-   Evidence of unauthorized access to privileged accounts\n\n-   Anomalous occurrences that are not related to specific applications\n    on the host.\n\n## Policy Compliance\n\n### Compliance Measurement\n\nThe Infosec team will verify compliance to this policy through various\nmethods, including but not limited to, periodic walk-thrus, video\nmonitoring, business tool reports, internal and external audits, and\nfeedback to the policy owner.\n\n## Exceptions\n\nAny exception to the policy must be approved by the Infosec team in\nadvance.\n\n## Non-Compliance\n\nAn employee found to have violated this policy may be subject to\ndisciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.\n\n## Related Documents\n\n-   [Server Audit Policy](server_audit_policy)\n\n-   [Technology  Equipment Disposal Policy](technology_equipment_disposal_policy)\n\n## Definitions and Terms\n\nThe following definition and terms can be found in the [SANS Glossary](https://www.sans.org/security-resources/glossary-of-terms/):\n\n-   De-militarized zone (DMZ)","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"ed2784d253ba347a4195e24bb1dee3bf","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":342},"frontmatter":{"title":"Server Security Policy","description":"Data Migrators' policy on server security.","keywords":"ibm,carbon,gatsby,mdx,markdown"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Server Security Policy\ndescription: Data Migrators' policy on server security.\nkeywords: 'ibm,carbon,gatsby,mdx,markdown'\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nThis page describes Data Migrators' policy on server security.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n  <AnchorLink>Overview</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Purpose</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Scope</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Policy</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Policy Compliance</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Exceptions</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Non-compliance</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Related Documents</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Definitions and Terms</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## Overview\n\nUnsecured and vulnerable servers continue to be a major entry point for\nmalicious threat actors.
