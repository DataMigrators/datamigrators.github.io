Passwords\nserve to protect user accounts; however, a poorly constructed password\nmay result in the compromise of individual systems, data, or network.\nThis guideline provides best practices for creating secure passwords.\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this guidelines is to provide best practices for the\ncreated of strong passwords.\n\n## Scope\n\nThis guideline applies to employees, contractors, consultants, temporary\nand other workers, including all personnel affiliated with third\nparties. This guideline applies to all passwords including but not\nlimited to user-level accounts, system-level accounts, web accounts,\ne-mail accounts, screen saver protection, voicemail, and local router\nlogins.\n\n## Statement of Guidelines\n\nStrong passwords are long, the more characters you have the stronger the\npassword. We recommend a minimum of 14 characters in your password. In\naddition, we highly encourage the use of passphrases, passwords made up\nof multiple words. Examples include \"*It's time for vacation*\" or\n\"*block-curious-sunny-leaves*\". Passphrases are both easy to remember\nand type, yet meet the strength requirements. Poor, or weak, passwords\nhave the following characteristics:\n\n-   Contain eight characters or less.\n-   Contain personal information such as birthdates, addresses, phone\n    numbers, or names of family members, pets, friends, and fantasy\n    characters.\n-   Contain number patterns such as `aaabbb`, `qwerty`, `zyxwvuts`, or `123321`.\n-   Are some version of `\"Welcome123\"` `\"Password123\"` `\"Changeme123\"`\n\nIn addition, every work account should have a different, unique\npassword. To enable users to maintain multiple passwords, we highly\nencourage the use of 'password manager' software that is authorized and\nprovided by the organization. Whenever possible, also enable the use of\nmulti-factor authentication.\n\n## Policy Compliance\n\n### Compliance Measurement\n\nThe Infosec team will verify compliance to this policy through various\nmethods, including but not limited to, periodic walk-thrus, video\nmonitoring, business tool reports, internal and external audits, and\nfeedback to the policy owner.\n\n## Exceptions\n\nAny exception to the policy must be approved by the Infosec team in\nadvance.\n\n## Non-Compliance\n\nAn employee found to have violated this policy may be subject to\ndisciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.\n\n## Related Documents\n\nNone.\n\n## Definitions and Terms\n\nNone.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"8447d5d15347e32601267df5ef727744","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":328},"frontmatter":{"title":"Password Construction Guidelines","description":"Usage instructions for the Markdown component","keywords":"ibm,carbon,gatsby,mdx,markdown"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Password Construction Guidelines\ndescription: Usage instructions for the Markdown component\nkeywords: 'ibm,carbon,gatsby,mdx,markdown'\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nThis page describes Data Migrators' guidelines for the construction of passwords.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n  <AnchorLink>Overview</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Purpose</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Scope</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Policy</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Policy Compliance</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Exceptions</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Non-compliance</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Related Documents</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Definitions and Terms</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## Overview\n\nPasswords are a critical component of information security.
